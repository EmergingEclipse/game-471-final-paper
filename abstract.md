abstract: "
Pyre takes a stance on many modern day issues with culture and humanity especially that of the outcast. The stances Pyre takes on these issues can be considered controversial by some. But also an important discussion for others since many people have not had to deal with it personally. The out casting of members of society is a punishment that very few fully understand and pyre poses this horrendous position in a more digestible format. Pyre poses the controversial question, should members of society be exiled for their crimes whether in prison or otherwise. Pyres question calls out what is wrong with society and shows us how we need to approach this difficult topic.
