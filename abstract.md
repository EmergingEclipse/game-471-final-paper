abstract: "

Pyre takes a stance on many modern-day issues with culture and humanity, especially that of the outcast. The stances Pyre takes on these issues can be considered controversial by some. But also a meaningful discussion for others since many people have not had to deal with it personally. The outcasting of members of society is a punishment that very few fully understand, and Pyre poses this horrendous position in a more digestible format. We all know that exile is undesirable, but we can also see that within Pyre, their return is exceptionally conditional; very few ever escape, and this is a blazing pyre in itself to today's justice. Pyre poses the controversial question, should members of society be exiled for their crimes, whether in prison or otherwise? Pyre shows us the members of the triumvirates are more than just characters; they have emotions and grow from their experiences much like real people. Pyre proves the point that when civilization does not want something visible or present, they send it away, just like in many large cities with their more disadvantaged populations. Pyre calls into question what is the true meaning of justice, Can People grow, and whether we can as humans, see the humanity within each other.

## introduction:
Pyre takes a stance on many modern-day issues with culture and humanity, especially that of the outcast. The stances Pyre takes on these issues can be considered controversial, considering its progressive-leaning depiction. But also, it prompts a meaningful discussion for others since many people have not had to deal with it personally. The outcasting of members of society is a punishment that very few fully understand, and Pyre poses this horrendous position in a more digestible format. We all know that exile is undesirable, but we can also see that within Pyre, their return is exceptionally conditional; very few ever escape, and this is a blazing pyre in itself to today's justice. Pyre poses the controversial question, should members of society be exiled for their crimes, whether in prison or otherwise? Pyre also demonstrates that the members of the triumvirates are more than just characters[^3]; they have emotions and grow from their experiences much like real people[^2]. We see that these characters can learn and grow from what they were exiled for just like members of our society that are shown mercy[^2]. Pyre proves the point that when civilization does not want something visible or present, they send it away, just like in many large cities with their more disadvantaged populations. Pyre calls into question what is the true meaning of justice, Can People grow, and whether we can, as humans, see the humanity within each other.

## Rehabilitation


Rehabilitation is one of the most critical pieces of learning and growing as a human is to make mistakes. As a child, you might scrape your knee or fall over; how did this happen? A mistake; plain and simple, we all learn from mistakes. Pyre brings to our attention within the first 5 minutes of gameplay that, you have been exiled to the downside for being able to read.[^1]. We can see that even after the first few minutes of gameplay that something about this world is unsettling. Carrying on, we discover that other characters have been exiled for various reasons, some for seemingly good reasons like smuggling or desertion, Rukey, and Jodariel, respectively, but in some cases, the exile is completely unwarranted with Sir Gilman as an example, having committed no actual crime[^4], we see that these characters have not been given a chance to argue why they should have stayed in the upper world, they have been given no opportunity to do so. We can look at ourselves as humans in the same light that we look at these characters; we see them as individuals, each with their own personalities and difficulties that they need to overcome, just like people do. Taking a look into how our justice systems can see those who make even a small mistake like petty theft are given the kick; even if they serve time, they still are likely to go back to their ways[^5], but if we look at people who have committed the same crime but have been treated in a humane way they move on and in a large portion of the people that are rehabilitated they contribute significantly less to the recidivism rate of the population.[^5]  

Pyre points out to us that the outrageousness of sending people away for little to nothing will not actually solve the problem, much like regimes around the world tend to do when they do not get their way, and we see that the commonwealth does the same.[^3] we must look at each and every possible case that people are going through in our justice systems much like we look and analyze the stories of the characters of Pyre, we empathize and pick our favorites, but we always listen to the details of each of their stories, we are rooting for them. We understand that exiling away those who cause problems solves the issues temporarily, but in the long term, it creates many more issues; the main one we will focus on is repeating offenses and recidivism. An article written by Jamie Santa Cruz and published in Knowable magazine breaks down a study of convicted persons who repeat offending after different lengths of prison sentences. It was found that the longer the prison sentences that were handed down to the offender correlated directly with the percentage of recidivism in that group of offenders.[^5]

we can look at the correlation within Pyre. We can see that ironically, the end of the game, depending on the ending that you reached, shows that this recidivism is very accurate in terms that they were exiled for life, and then when they make it back to the surface, they then immediately start a coup d'Ã©tat.[^3]




## Hiding Away the Undesirables


We all know that prison is not a very pretty idea, nor is it something we really want to think about; we can see in Pyre that since many of the characters are there without reason, we must draw some conclusion about why theta re there, we look at the different pieces of society that many do not want to see, or even necessarily think about. Sir Gilman or Bertrude, or even any of the harps. Compared to many modern systems like American or Canadian prison and justice systems, the ratios of certain groups are disparaging to specific demographics.[^6] While SuperGiant, the developer and publisher of Pyre,  may not have been referring directly to this when they designed this game, I would say it would be quite a stretch to say that the world design in such similarity to ours was not thought of. We see that the commonwealth exiles almost all harps they come in contact with due to the war they are fighting; they also exile Wyrms and other characters they do not want to be seen around. Bertrude is not the most attractive character, and it is quite clear that the commonwealth does not want her around. Even those playing the game casually without thinking about the difficult questions of exile and hard topics will have the complex question of whether they should judge books by their cover like Bertrude or if they will listen to the whole story before making that decision. Much like the examples of cities during bids for the Olympics or other significant events where the world's eye is on them, they will rush to clear those we do not want to see from the streets. This great exodus shows the retaliation of such careless displacement, recidivism, and crime returns.[^6] Pyre notes that some of the downsides inhabitants were rebels, some were enemies, and some were exiled for being able to read.[^3] we look at many cultures around the world this is the case, we as humans tend to be biased, and regardless of where we go, this is the case, including in video games this happens. Harps are disproportionately sent to the downside because of their race. And regardless of the reasoning why we should look into it more deeply and see why the commonwealth makes it clear that they are at war. So in this context, the harps relatively make sense for their exile; in the real world, we see why people are placed into our version of exile. We can look at all of our systems in recorded history, and it never is genuinely fair[^5], whether it be a bias or a misunderstanding we should look at all the facts and what the exiles effect will have. we can see into these situations but never really have a say; Pyre gives us a chance to experience what this is in the format of a game; we can understand the depth and emotion that each of the people in the real world goes through, much like the characters you would empathize with.

-People being empathetic decides many situations



-Pyre, just like many north american and asian justice systems, has exiles that struggle to reintegrate with society.




-Pyre, when looked at in a symbolic sense, calls out justice in a way some may see as controversial.
