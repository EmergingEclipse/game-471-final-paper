abstract: "

Pyre takes a stance on many modern-day issues with culture and humanity, especially that of the outcast. The stances Pyre takes on these issues can be considered controversial by some. But also a meaningful discussion for others since many people have not had to deal with it personally. The outcasting of members of society is a punishment that very few fully understand, and Pyre poses this horrendous position in a more digestible format. We all know that exile is undesirable, but we can also see that within Pyre, their return is exceptionally conditional; very few ever escape, and this is a blazing pyre in itself to today's justice. Pyre poses the controversial question, should members of society be exiled for their crimes, whether in prison or otherwise? Pyre shows us the members of the triumvirates are more than just characters; they have emotions and grow from their experiences much like real people. Pyre proves the point that when civilization does not want something visible or present, they send it away, just like in many large cities with their more disadvantaged populations. Pyre calls into question what is the true meaning of justice, Can People grow, and whether we can as humans, see the humanity within each other.

##introduction:
Pyre takes a stance on many modern-day issues with culture and humanity, especially that of the outcast. The stances Pyre takes on these issues can be considered controversial, considering its progressive-leaning depiction. But also, it prompts a meaningful discussion for others since many people have not had to deal with it personally. The outcasting of members of society is a punishment that very few fully understand, and Pyre poses this horrendous position in a more digestible format. We all know that exile is undesirable, but we can also see that within Pyre, their return is exceptionally conditional; very few ever escape, and this is a blazing pyre in itself to today's justice. Pyre poses the controversial question, should members of society be exiled for their crimes, whether in prison or otherwise? Pyre also demonstrates that the members of the triumvirates are more than just characters[^3]; they have emotions and grow from their experiences much like real people[^2]. We see that these characters can learn and grow from what they were exiled for just like members of our society that are shown mercy[^2]. Pyre proves the point that when civilization does not want something visible or present, they send it away, just like in many large cities with their more disadvantaged populations. Pyre calls into question what is the true meaning of justice, Can People grow, and whether we can, as humans, see the humanity within each other.
